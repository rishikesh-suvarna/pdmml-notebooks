    "#The Problem: You are tasked with constructing and evaluating a decision tree classifier on this dataset. Utilize and compare different types of split criteria (entropy, Gini index, loss). The decision tree will classify the type of car into one of the following categories: 1) unacceptable, 2) acceptable, 3) good, or 4) very good.\n",
